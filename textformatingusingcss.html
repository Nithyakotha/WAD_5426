        <h2>Early life</h2><hr>
        <p>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS born on<b> 7 November 1888 â€“ 21 November 1970</b> was an <i><b>Indian physicist</b> </i>known for his work in the field of light scattering.Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when <u>light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and frequency.</u> This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called <tt>"modified scattering"</tt> was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.</p>
        <h2>Carrer</h2><hr>
        <p>Born to Tamil Brahmin parents, <big>Raman was a precocious child,</big> completing his secondary and higher secondary education from <small>St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School </small>at the ages of 11 and 13, respectively. He topped the <sub>bachelor's degree examination of the University of Madras</sub> with honours in physics from Presidency College at age 16. His first research paper, on <sup>diffraction of light,</sup> was published in 1906 while he was still a graduate student. The next year he obtained a master's degree. He joined the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta as Assistant Accountant General at age 19. There he became acquainted with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute in India, which allowed him to do independent research and where he made his major contributions in acoustics and optics.</p>
